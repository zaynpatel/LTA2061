FinalProject contains the FinalLSA.ipynb which applies Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to five poems. 

If you are visiting this repository from [TAAS](https://github.com/zaynpatel/TAAS) visit [PracticeLSA2.ipynb](https://github.com/zaynpatel/LTA2061/blob/main/PracticeLSA2.ipynb) for a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) of 3 Trump articles on Immigration Policy and one St. Patrick's Day Team Bonding blog. This notebook includes explanations of several important linear algebra concepts (SVD, Low rank approximations, eigenthings, rank from multiple perspectives) and aims to provide strong mathematical intuition for why and how the latent semantic analysis works. The example I chose is *very illustrative.* 

**Note: The TF-IDF explanation in PracticeLSA2 has incorrect code. Please refer to [calculate.ipynb](https://github.com/zaynpatel/LTA2061/blob/main/FinalProject/calculate.ipynb) for the correct code and explanation of term frequency. Inverse document frequency is correctly explained in PracticeLSA2 as is the rest of the math.**
